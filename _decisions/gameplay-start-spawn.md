## Why is there need for such a decision?

To set uniform rules for the start of the game.

## Alternatives not seriously considered

One service (game service) is responsible for initially spawing one robot for each player.

## How is this decision evaluated?

Discussion with all project members.

## Resolution Details

No robots are provided for players at the start of the game. The players get start money and can decide for themselves how many robots they want to spawn.

## Reasons for the resolution

This decision was made mainly to simplify the initialization process of the game. It also leaves the player free to choose how to start the game and opens up possibilities for even more different strategies.
