## Why is there need for such a decision?

Each team needs to be clear about the business events (deep yellow stickers) and commands (blue stickers)
from the [Event Storming results](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lsQV7ZA=/). They are the blueprint for 
designing the features and API(s) of the service.

In addition, it needs to be checked if the event/command list is consistent with the other teams' lists.
Any conflicts, especially about who should receive which command?
