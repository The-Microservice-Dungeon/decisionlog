---

## Why is there need for such a decision?

No development can start before the technology stack (esp. programming language) has been chosen by the team.

## Additional sources for better understanding the background

n/a

## Viable Options

- Java / Kotlin as Language since it is taught in AP1/AP2, PP and ST1/2
- Spring as Application framework since it is taught in (at least) ST2

## Alternatives not seriously considered

Nearly every other language and framework since we can't assume any experiences with techonlogies 
offside the standard curriculum of the computer science Bachelor's degree at the TH KÃ¶ln. 

## How is this decision evaluated?

Curriculum of the bachelors degree
 
## Resolution Details

We decide to use Spring as application framework and let the decision open for the coders 
to choose between Java and Kotlin since both languages are interoparable usable and compatible to Spring.

## Reasons for the resolution

- No coder attended at meeting
