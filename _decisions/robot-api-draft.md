## Why is there need for such a decision?

This decision will serve as a kickoff for formally specifying the REST APIs.

## Viable Options

### /robot/
- is used to create (spawn) robots
- if you post a robot, you need to include playerUUID in the payload

### /robot/{robotUUID}
- GET all th information about the specified robot

### /robot/{robotUUID}/upgrades
- GET the current update status of the specified robot and its possible upgrades
- the trade-service can UPDATE a specific upgrade to the next level
- (may need further discussion)

### /robot/{robotUUID}?attribute=att1,att2,att3,â€¦,attN
- request only the specified attributes of the robot
- (needs to be further discussed)

### /robot/command
- this is for posting player commands and will be used by the game-service
- commands can be posted as a list
- every command has to include the commandUUID
- result of a command will be accessible by the commandUUID
- when a command has been executed, an event with the corresponding commandUUID will be posted

#### commands:
- block [playerUUID] [robotUUID]
- move [playerUUID] [robotUUID] [targetPlanetUUID]
- fight [playerUUID] [robotUUID] [targetRobotUUID]
- mine [playerUUID] [robotUUID]
- regenerate [playerUUID] [robotUUID]
- use_item [playerUUID] [robotUUID] [itemType] [targetUUID]
    - targetUUID is either a planet or a robot, depending on the itemType
- robot_info [playerUUID] [playerAuthToken]
    - allows a player to get the info of all their robots. Only used for the testing phase, will not be available in the final game
    - implementation is low priority
