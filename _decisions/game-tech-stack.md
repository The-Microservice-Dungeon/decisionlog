## Why is there need for such a decision?

No development can start before the technology stack (esp. programming language) has been chosen by the team.

## Additional sources for better understanding the background

-

## Viable Options

Spring with Kotlin

## Alternatives not seriously considered

Spring with Java 

## How is this decision evaluated?

The decision was based on the experience the team had regarding the possibilities for programming languages. Further in 
educational context its good to learn Kotlin because its in comparison especially to Java a new programming language.
 
## Resolution Details

The game service will be programmed using spring and kotlin as the programming language. As a building tool maven was chosen over gradle.

## Reasons for the resolution

The resolution was based on the experience of the team with this technologies duo to the work in softwaretechnik and other modules of previous semesters. Also they can 
get the best support for this via the internet and the supervisors
