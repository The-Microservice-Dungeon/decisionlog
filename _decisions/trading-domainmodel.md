## Why is there need for such a decision?

The (sub-)domain model is a prerequisite for planning the development - which entities, value objects, aggregates 
do I have? 

In addition, it needs to be checked if the domain model is consistent with the other teams' (sub-)domain models.
Especially: Are there any conflicts with regard to entity ownership?
