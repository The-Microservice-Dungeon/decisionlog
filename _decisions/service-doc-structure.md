## Why is there need for such a decision?

We need to have a common base structure in the developer documentation for each service (what issues need to be 
covered), so that you are sure to find the required aspects. 

## Additional sources for better understanding the background

We need a API documentation structure that's easy to use and (int the best case) will be autamaticly generated and updated.

## Viable Options

<ul>
<li>OpenAPI/li>
</ul>


## Alternatives not seriously considered

<ul>
<li>GitBook only</li>
</ul>


## How is this decision evaluated?
The decision was evaluated by checking whether the tool or structure is used in the industry. Furthermore, the simplicity of use was also taken into consideration. As well as whether the standard is supported by our infrastructure (gitBook).
